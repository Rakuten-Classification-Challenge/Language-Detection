# Language-Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a language detection system developed as part of an application project at **UKP Lab, Technische Universität Darmstadt**.

The system was designed to detect the language of texts based on the analysis of the paper “Empathy and Compassion” by **Tania Singer & Olga M. Klimecki**.

### Project Overview
**Purpose:** Automatically identify the language of input texts.

**Dataset:** Text excerpts from the paper on Empathy by Singer & Klimecki.

**Use case:** Support linguistic analysis and processing in research contexts.

### Features
Text preprocessing tailored for academic papers.

Robust language classification model.

Easy integration for further natural language processing tasks.
